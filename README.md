The REX-C100 is a “PID temperature controller” that can be bought cheaply from China.  However they’ve got a number of limitations depending on application.

This project replaces the microcontroller board in the C100 with a new board with PSOC 4200 microcontroller and some prototyping space.

The PSOC project in this repo has the front board driving code, allowing the LED displays, switches and indicator LEDs to function.
